# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Labs

## Description
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) labs solved as part of the DSA module in our course. The labs cover a wide range of foundational topics in computer science, from basic sorting and searching algorithms to more advanced concepts like graph algorithms, binary search trees, and heaps. Each lab is implemented with a focus on understanding the underlying principles of DSA and optimizing for performance and efficiency.
